# This is fine for now as I just want to build a demo of the game.
# Eventually need to fix this as I want to just call the folder itself, so that
# I don't have to write a whole bunch of imports cause that sounds terribly lol.

# For the most part everything in terms of importing Characters and Items is done.
# Need to start working on the main.py because it's just a mess lol.
# After that I need to work on the inventory system as there really isn't one
# for the inventory system I'm thinking about using a dicitionary, so that we 
# can keep track of the items.  After that we can implement enemies to simulate comabt.
# Finally start making the actual locations and possibly NPC's later on.
